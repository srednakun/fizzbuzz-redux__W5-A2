# Week 5 Day 2

We're focusing on event management and DOM manipulation in tonight's
assignment. Take the FizzBuzz project you worked on (or re-write it if you
want) and convert it to a JavaScript class that will write content to the DOM
based on user input.

## Requirements

* Must write FizzBuzz as a Class that can be instantiated (e.g. new FizzBuzz()
* Class must have at least two methods: write and read
* Class should be instantiated on page load
* Markup must include a form where a user can specify the start and end values for the range of FizzBuzz
* processing must be triggered by form submission (it should work with a keypress of “enter” AS WELL as clicking the button)
* read method must accept two values - a start and an end (1 to 100, 32 to 1000, etc)
* write method must take the output of the FizzBuzz program and inject it in to the HTML page (use semantic markup)
* write method must clear the output target when writing new code
* write method must also disply the start and end values
* JavaScript must be written in an external file (just like you would for any other project)
* Extra Credit: (5 pts) 
  * give the user the option to append content (rather than replace it, which is the default behavior)

## Constraints

Must be valid, sematic, HTML. Don't worry about overall styling (though it never hurts).

jQuery and external libraries are NOT to be used. All JavaScript should be your own.

Work on this individually. Fork this repository and submit a pull-request back to it. Submit links via canvas.

**DO NOT** fence yourself in with invisible constraints. Unless it is
specifically listed and/or we discussed it in lecture, there is not an
expectation to meet an objective that has not been set.
